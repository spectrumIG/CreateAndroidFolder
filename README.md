CreateAndroidFolder
===================


This little script is used as a Nautilus plugin, but it's absolutly trivial to make it a normal shell script.

It just makes as many density folders as selected, for drawable or layout. It's not smart enough to combine different resource query except density identifier.

I made it because i deal with a lot of stupid people who force me to change Android resources multiple time and i was tired of making all that folders by hand. 


Hope someone will appriciate
